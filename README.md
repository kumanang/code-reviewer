# AI Code Review Workflow

## Overview
This repository integrates **AI-powered code review** into GitHub workflows, allowing for **automated analysis** of code changes in pull requests. The AI provides **inline suggestions** directly in the PR, helping developers improve code quality before merging.

The AI focuses on **code formatting, readability, security issues, performance optimizations, and refactoring suggestions**. Each comment includes a **confidence score**, indicating how certain the AI is about its suggestion.

By automating code review, this workflow helps:  
- ✅ Reduce **manual effort** in reviewing PRs.  
- ✅ Catch **common mistakes early** in the development process.  
- ✅ Ensure **coding standards** are followed consistently.  
- ✅ Improve **overall code quality** with AI-driven insights.
